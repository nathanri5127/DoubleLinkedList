OVERVIEW:

 This program implements a double-linked list with methods to manage the list. It also implemenents a ListIterator with
base methods to navigate the list.


INCLUDED FILES:

 IUDoubleLinkedList- The class file for the double-linked list
 ListTester- The testing file for the class.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 The double-linked list comes with methods to manage the list. Setter methods such as addAfter() and remove() aswell
as getter methods such as first() and last(). There is also a toString method to convey the list into a meaningful
string. The class also implements a listIterator, which navigates through the list with the next() and previous()
methods. The listIterator also has the remove(), set(), and add() methods to change the list from the iterator
level. 

TESTING:

 I was able to use the testing methods I already made in the previous assignments to navigate my debugging process.
 Anything that didnt work I was able to fix the debugging program in Eclipse. The listIterator gave me the most amount
 of issues and I wasnt able to get everything working properly in time, so there will still be errors in the double-linked list.

DISCUSSION:
 
 I started with implementing the base double-linked list methods, such as the contains() and indexOf() functions, which
 was easy as they have similarity with the single-linked list. The base Iterator was also easy to implement for the same
 reason. The listIterator was the part that gave me the most trouble as I still have some confusion about it, but it is 
 mostly complete with some bugs.
